For learning parallel programming in Python as an intermediate Python engineer:

### 1. **Introduction to Parallel Programming**
   - Understanding concurrency vs. parallelism
   - CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound tasks
   - The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python and its impact on parallelism

### 2. **Threading in Python**
   - Basics of threading (`threading` module)
   - Creating and managing threads
   - Synchronization between threads (Locks, Semaphores, etc.)
   - Thread pools (`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`)
   - Threading limitations with GIL

### 3. **Multiprocessing in Python**
   - Basics of multiprocessing (`multiprocessing` module)
   - Creating and managing processes
   - Shared memory and inter-process communication (IPC)
     - Queues
     - Pipes
     - Shared variables (e.g., `Value`, `Array`)
   - Process pools (`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`)
   - Avoiding GIL limitations with multiprocessing

### 4. **Asynchronous Programming**
   - Introduction to asynchronous programming
   - Event loops and `asyncio` module
   - Defining and running `async` functions
   - `await` and `async` keyword usage
   - Concurrent coroutines with `asyncio.gather()` and `asyncio.wait()`
   - `asyncio` vs. threading/multiprocessing for I/O-bound tasks

### 5. **Parallel Programming Patterns**
   - Divide and conquer
   - MapReduce
   - Task queues
   - Work stealing

### 6. **Parallel Programming Tools and Libraries**
   - **Joblib**: Parallel processing with simple APIs (`Parallel`, `delayed`)
   - **Dask**: Parallel computing with Dask data structures and task graphs
   - **Ray**: A distributed computing framework for Python (remote functions, parallel actors)
   - **PySpark**: Parallel processing for big data with Spark and Python
   - **Celery**: Distributed task queue for concurrent task execution

### 7. **Parallel Data Processing with NumPy and Pandas**
   - `numpy` operations leveraging multiple cores (e.g., `numpy.dot()`)
   - Parallelizing `pandas` operations with `Dask` or `modin`

### 8. **Profiling and Optimizing Parallel Code**
   - Profiling CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound tasks
   - `cProfile` for performance profiling
   - Memory profiling (`memory_profiler`)
   - Identifying bottlenecks in parallel programs
   - Avoiding race conditions and deadlocks

### 9. **Distributed Computing**
   - Concepts of distributed computing
   - Clusters, nodes, and task scheduling
   - Frameworks: Ray, PySpark, Dask for distributed processing

### 10. **Real-World Use Cases**
   - Data science and machine learning model training
   - Web scraping with threading and async programming
   - File processing with multiprocessing (reading/writing large files)
   - Network services (parallelizing I/O operations)
